# US-Visa-Prediction-Project

In this project we are going to analyze the data given and build a classification model:

   * Facilitate the process of visa approvals. </li>
   * Recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status. 
     
  
This project is done as a part of Project of the Week at DataTalks.Club
